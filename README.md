## Overview

This is my solution to the Frontend Mentor QR component coding challenge. I initially started a junior project, but felt like it would be more appropriate to start smaller as I have very little experience.

## My process

I started with the boilerplate code, including text. 
My first step was to add the relevant tags to the text.
I then placed the image and text in a div container, in order to style the QR component. 

Next, I added all the colors for the project in CSS using variables, and then applied the colors to the relevant sections. In order to style the items in the container I decided to use flexbox, as I felt this would be the easiest and fastest way to create something close to the design. 

### Built with

- flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned how I can use variables in CSS
- I learned how to center a single div within the body. I do wonder whether the implementation could be better. I feel a little uncomfortable that I needed to give the body a height of 100vh.
